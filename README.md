<h2>STOCK CLOSING PRICE PREDICTOR</h2>
This project predicts the closing stock price for different companies (like Google, Facebook, Microsoft) using Machine Learning. The application is developed in Jupyter Notebook using an artificial recurrent neural network called Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). The application uses key libraries such as Keras (Tensorflow), sklearn, numpy and pandas. Feel free to check out the Stock Predictions.ipynb file to see how the application works. I have used the stocks of Google as an example to demonstrate and have included the results in the form of visualization as well.
